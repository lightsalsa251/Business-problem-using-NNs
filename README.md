This is a model for a bank problem in which the bank decides that if a customer will discontinue banking with them or not. A deep neural network is a neural network architecture with more than one hidden layer technically. But in practice there are many more hidden layers. Each unit does a summation of weights multiplied by the inputs. Then an activation function is applied. This output is the input for the next layer. The output layer produces an output, with which an error is calculated and is back-propagated. Every weight is updated according to its share of error using an optimiser.\

## Activation Functions
* ReLu, sigmoid and tanh are the most popular hidden layer activation functions used.
* For output layer the activation functions used commonly are softmax and sigmoid.
